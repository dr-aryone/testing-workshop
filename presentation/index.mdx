# Testing Workshop

---

## Why?

---

_“The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.”_

---

## What the fuck does it mean anyway?

---

#### Don't test the implementation of a function, test the result

---

#### So should I write unit tests everywhere and I'm good to go?

---

👻

## Nope.

---

#### Testing an individual component is important

---

_but_

---

#### Testing how all these components work together is arguably more important.

---

😉

#### Your users do not care about how your app is structured or what technology you are using

---

# Snapshot testing

---

😄

#### They protect against regression really well

---

😔

#### Sometimes you can’t tell what is being tested, and you could fall into a bad habit of updating snapshot tests blindly

---

#### If your component does not update often, is not complex, and is easy to see exactly what you are testing, then a snapshot test _might_ work.

---

## Implementation

---

#### You should always ask yourself:

---

_“Does it help test how our users use this application?”_

---

#### If the answer is: _"yes"_

---

#### Test how the user will really see and use your application

and

#### Test if your compoment renders correctly

---

#### If the answer is: _"no"_

---

#### Just test if your compoment renders correctly

---

_Yeah, simple as that._

---

🤓

## _"But how can I create tests?"_

---

#### I use _testing-library_ and _jest_ to write my tests, and I'm gonna show you how I usually do it.

---

#### Imagine a page like this:

---

import Counter from "../src/pages/Counter/Counter.js";

<div
  style={{
    padding: "20px"
  }}>
  <Counter />
</div>

---

## What should I test there?

---

## Checkout this guiding principles

https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles

---

## We will test:

- If it render without errors

- If it matches the snapshot

- If it start with 0

- If the _increment-decrement_ works

---

## Always start your component by its tests

So the first thing you'll do when you start to create this component is create a _Counter.test.js_

---

## You'll need these imports:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
```

---

## Describe what you're testing

```js
describe("Counter Page", () => {...});
```

---

## Start with RLM

- Render the component

- Load the component

- Match the snapshot

---

#### You can learn more about them and their priorities here:

https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-which-query

---

#### But mainly, just keep in mind that you always try to select visible stuff like _text_, _placeholder_, _label_ and etc

---

## Test if it renders

```js
it("Renders without crashing", () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.createElement("div"));
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(document.createElement("div"));
});
```

---

## Test if it loads

```js
it("Loads component", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const counter = getByTestId("counterContainer");
  expect(counter).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

---

## Test if it matches the snapshot

```js
it("Match Snapshot", () => {
  const { firstChild } = render(<Counter />);
  expect(firstChild).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

---

## With these tests, you already have a good start to begin your **real** tests

---

## We will check:

- If the initial value of the counter is **0**

- If the increment works

- If the decrement works

---

## Test if the counter start with **0**

```js
it("Loads with initial counter as 0", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const countValue = getByTestId("countValue");
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("0");
});
```

---

## Test if the increment works

```js
it("Increment work", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const countValue = getByTestId("countValue");
  const increment = getByTestId("incrementButton");
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("0");
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) fireEvent.click(increment);
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("10");
});
```

---

## Test if the decrement works

```js
it("Decrement work", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const countValue = getByTestId("countValue");
  const decrement = getByTestId("decrementButton");
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("0");
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) fireEvent.click(decrement);
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("-10");
});
```

🎉

## Profit

---

?

## The real question is:

---

🔷

_"If I do it, is this component unbreakable?"_

---

👻

## Nope.

---

####

😁

#### But at least it gives you more confidence, right?

---

#### Yeah, _but_ only if you test real user interaction, not plain functions

---

## And always remember

---

#### If you struggle to test something, _you fucked up_

---

## Summary

- Always create the test first
- “Does it help test how our users use this application?”
- Never put the blame on the test
- Don't cry when a bug appears in production 😂

---

🔥

## Bonus

---

#### If I were you, I would add a _pre-push_ script, so you doesn't fuck your branch

---

## To do so, you just follow these steps:

- Install _husky_ to your project
- Add a _pre-push_ script to your _package.json_

```js
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-push": "npm run test"
    }
  },
```

---
