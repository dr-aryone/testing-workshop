# Testing Workshop

---

## Why?

---

_“The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.”_

---

## What the fuck does it mean anyway?

---

Don't test the implementation of a function, test the result

---

## So should I write unit tests everywhere and I'm good to go?

---

👻

Nope.

---

💪

Testing an individual component is important

---

_but_

---

🙏

Testing how all these components work together is arguably more important.

---

😉

Your users do not care about how your app is structured or what technology you are using

---

# Snapshot testing

---

😄

The more useful aspect of these tests is that they protect against regression really well

---

😔

The downside is that sometimes you can’t tell what is being tested, and you could fall into a bad habit of updating snapshot tests blindly

---

If your component does not update often, is not complex, and is easy to see exactly what you are testing, then a snapshot test _might_ work.

---

## Implementation

---

Always should always ask yourself:

---

_“Does it help test how our users use this application?”_

---

If the answer is: _"yes"_

---

**Test how the user will really see and use your application**

---

If the answer is: _"no"_

---

**Test if your compoment renders correctly**

---

Yeah, simple as that.

---

🤓

## _"But Pedro, can I create tests?"_

---

I use _testing-library_ and _jest_ to write my tests, and I'm gonna show you how I usually do it.

---

Imagine a page like this:

---

import Counter from "../src/pages/Counter/Counter.js";

<Counter />

---

What should I test there?

---

- If it render without errors

- If it matches the snapshot

- If it start with 0

- If the _increment-decrement_ works

---

## First of all

Always start your component by its tests

---

So the first thing you'll do when you start to create this component is create a `Counter.test.js`

---

## Checkout this guiding principles

https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles

---

You'll need these imports:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
```

---

## Always describe what you're testing

`describe("Counter Page", () => { "tests here" });`

---

## Start with RLM

- Render the component

- Load the component

- Match the snapshot

---

## Test if it renders

```js
it("Renders without crashing", () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.createElement("div"));
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(document.createElement("div"));
});
```

---

## Test if it loads

```js
it("Loads component", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const counter = getByTestId("counterContainer");
  expect(counter).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

---

## Test if it matches the snapshot

```js
it("Match Snapshot", () => {
  const { firstChild } = render(<Counter />);
  expect(firstChild).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

---

With these tests, you already have a good start to begin your **real** tests

---

I'll use some selectors, you can learn more about them and its priorities here:

https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-which-query

---

But mainly, just keep in mind that you always prioritize visible stuff like `text`, `placeholder`, `label` and etc

---

## Now to the real tests

---

## Test if the counter start with 0

```js
it("Loads with initial counter as 0", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const countValue = getByTestId("countValue");
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("0");
});
```

---

## Test if the increment work

```js
it("Increment work", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const countValue = getByTestId("countValue");
  const increment = getByTestId("incrementButton");
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("0");
  fireEvent.click(increment);
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("1");
});
```

---

## Test if the decrement work

```js
it("Decrement work", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Counter />);
  const countValue = getByTestId("countValue");
  const decrement = getByTestId("decrementButton");
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("0");
  fireEvent.click(decrement);
  expect(countValue.textContent).toBe("-1");
});
```

---

🎉

## Profit

---

## The real question is:

_"Pedro, if I do it, is this component unbreakable?"_

---

👻

Nope.

---

But at least it gives you more confidence, right?

---

Yes, _but_ only if you test real actions, not functions

---

Always remember

**If you struggle to test something, its because you messed up**

---

## Just for you to remember

- Always create the test first
- “Does it help test how our users use this application?”
- Never put the blame on the test, it's your fault
- Don't cry when a bug appears in production
